Hello, what's up?

Let me do a short introduction about my humble self. My name is JT, currently working for a very awesome Malaysian startup named TableApp as a software developer. So if you need to book any restaurants without any fuss, you can it out in [Android][android-app]{:target="_blank"}, [IOS][ios-app]{:target="_blank"}, or the [Website][tableapp]{:target="_blank"}. 

I am quite familar with a couple of programming languages and technologies such as Android, Java, Groovy, Python, PHP and a little bit of *this* and *that*. 

I am also being exposed to quite a few entrepreneurial stuffs as well despite I haven't start anything up myself yet. (being surrounded by amazing people that really do stuffs and being blasted by so many people that keep screaming **STARTUPS!! STARTUPS!! STARTUPS!!** on Facebook will do that to you)

So here's my first entry of a blog post. I will try my best to update what I learned from others be it tech or whatever! Hope whatever you that read here will be useful for you!
